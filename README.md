# Agriculture Monitoring System App
An app helps to display agricultural data such as temperature, moisture, and pH level in the form of dashboards. Even the authentication system aids in the management of different  dashboards. Every user has various dashboards based on the number of fields, a rounded progress bar to display temperature and moisture data, and a button to operate sprinkler on/off status.
